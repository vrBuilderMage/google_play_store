Effective Date: 07/02/2025

Thank you for using Hashuffle (the "App"), developed by Oleksandr Hlynskyy ("us", "we", or "our").

**1. No Data Collection**

We are committed to protecting your privacy. Hashuffle does **not** collect, store, use, transmit, or share any personal information or any other data from you or your device.

The App operates entirely locally on your device. It does not require an internet connection for its core functionality.

**2. Information You Provide Voluntarily**

The App does not request or allow you to provide any personal information.

**3. Third-Party Services**

Hashuffle does **not** integrate with any third-party services that would collect data from you through your use of the App.

**4. Children's Privacy**

Since Hashuffle does not collect any personal information, it is inherently safe for use by individuals of all ages, including children. We do not knowingly collect any information from children under the age of 13 (or the relevant age in your jurisdiction). If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal information (which should not be possible through this app), please contact us so that we will be able to do the necessary actions.
